 Chepy Streamlit App

An interactive web app built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that harnesses the powerful capabilities of the [Chepy](https://github.com/securisec/chepy) Python library. This app provides a simple and user-friendly interface for developers, cybersecurity professionals, and data analysts to perform various text, binary, file, network, and data transformation operations.

 What is Chepy?

**Chepy** is a versatile and powerful Swiss army knife for developers and security professionals. It provides a wide range of operations for:

- Text manipulation (case conversion, encoding, hashing)
- Binary and hex transformations
- Network requests (GET/POST)
- File parsing and analysis
- JSON beautification and transformation

Chepy allows for chaining multiple operations programmatically, but in this Streamlit app, we've adapted its key features for a graphical interface that requires no coding experience.
